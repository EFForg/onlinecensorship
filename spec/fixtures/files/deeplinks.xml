    <title>Victory! Illinois Supreme Court Protects Biometric Privacy</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/victory-illinois-supreme-court-protects-biometric-privacy</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field__items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field__item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the Illinois Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2019/123186.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;ruled unanimously&lt;/a&gt; that when companies collect biometric data like fingerprints or face prints without informed opt-in consent, they can be sued. Users don&#039;t need to prove an injury like identity fraud or physical harm—just losing control of one’s biometric privacy is injury enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Rosenbach v. Six Flags&lt;/em&gt;, a 14 year old brought a challenge against an amusement park for collecting his thumbprint without his informed consent, in violation of Illinois law. The law in question, the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004&amp;amp;ChapterID=57&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;BIPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), prohibits companies from gathering, using, or sharing biometric information without informed opt-in consent.  EFF, along with ACLU, CDT, the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation, PIRG, and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/advocating-change-how-lucy-parsons-labs-defends-transparency-chicago&quot;&gt;Lucy Parsons Labs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, filed an &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/2018-07-05-rosenbach-v-six-flags-amicus-brief-privacy-groups&quot;&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; urging the Illinois Supreme Court to adopt a robust interpretation of BIPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Supreme Court agreed with us and soundly rejected the defendants’ argument that BIPA required a person to show an injury beyond loss of statutory privacy rights. The Court rejected the company’s argument that violation of a privacy statute is a mere “technical violation of the law.” In fact, the Court ruled, it inflicts a serious harm that supports a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court recognized that, through BIPA, the legislature had codified an individual’s “right to privacy in and control over their biometric identifiers and biometric information.” The need to codify this right was supported by the legislature’s findings that biometrics may be used to access sensitive information, but unlike other identifiers like social security numbers, biometrics are unique to each individual and can’t be changed. As a result, the Court ruled, quoting the legislature: “once compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at heightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from biometric-facilitated transactions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reason, the court held, a person is “clearly ‘aggrieved’” under BIPA through the mere violation of the act alone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a private entity fails to adhere to the statutory procedures, as defendants are alleged to have done here, “the right of the individual to maintain [their] biometric privacy vanishes into thin air. The precise harm the Illinois legislature sought to prevent is then realized.” &lt;em&gt;This is no mere “technicality.” The injury is real and significant.&lt;/em&gt; (Emphasis added.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois’ BIPA is the strongest biometric privacy law in the United States. As biometric collection, use, and sharing become more widespread and invasive every year, it only becomes more important that private citizens can sue under laws like BIPA to protect their privacy. More businesses than ever are capturing and monetizing our biometric information. Retailers use face recognition to &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/23/facial-recognition-is-tracking-customers-as-they-shop-in-stores-tech-company-says.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;surveil shoppers’ behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as they move about the store, and to &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lowes.com/l/privacy-and-security-statement.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;identify potential shoplifters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Employers use fingerprints, iris scans, and face recognition to manage &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/18/technology/biometrics-workplace/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;employee access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to company phones and computers. People have filed BIPA lawsuits against major technology companies like &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-facebook-tagging-privacy-lawsuit-20180417-story.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law360.com/articles/901827/google-wants-7th-circ-s-input-in-biometric-privacy-row&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/does-snapchats-lenses-feature-violate-illinois-biometrics-law/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, alleging the companies applied face recognition to their uploaded photographs without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF and other privacy groups for years &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/danger-corporate-facial-recognition-tech&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/new-attack-illinois-biometric-privacy-act&quot;&gt;resisted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; big business &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Technology-Council-Newsletter-.html?soid=1109152397846&amp;amp;aid=ddA4c7TeoaA&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to gut BIPA. Laws like BIPA that allow private citizens to sue are necessary for several reasons. First, biometric surveillance is a growing menace to our privacy. Our biometric information can be harvested at a distance and without our knowledge, and we often have no ability as individuals to effectively shield ourselves from this grave privacy intrusion. Second, BIPA follows in the footsteps of a host of other privacy laws that prohibit the capture of private information absent informed opt-in consent, and that define capture without notice and consent by itself as an injury. Third, allowing private lawsuits is a necessary means to ensure effective enforcement of privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Rosenbach&lt;/em&gt; case has important ramifications for another case brought under BIPA challenging Facebook’s use of biometric face surveillance without users’ consent. That case, &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2015cv03747/290385/333/0.pdf?ts=1523951115&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;In re Facebook Biometric Information Privacy Litigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (also called &lt;em&gt;Patel v. Facebook&lt;/em&gt;), is currently on appeal in the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California. Like the defendants in &lt;em&gt;Rosenbach&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook has argued that a loss of statutory biometric privacy rights is not enough to sue a company, but instead, the plaintiff must also show additional harm. EFF and our privacy allies filed an &lt;em&gt;amicus curiae&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/eff-appellate-court-protect-biometric-privacy&quot;&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt; in this case, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Facebook &lt;/em&gt;district court rejected this argument last year, as did the Illinois Supreme Court today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re hopeful the &lt;em&gt;Rosenbach&lt;/em&gt; ruling shuts down this argument once and for all. The Illinois Supreme Court cited the California &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; case with approval and quoted from it extensively. Now it’s up to the Ninth Circuit to allow that case to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>In WSJ Op-Ed, Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Down to Users and Misses the Point </title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/wsj-op-ed-mark-zuckerberg-speaks-down-users-and-misses-point</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field__items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field__item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mark Zuckerberg’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facts-about-facebook-11548374613&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (paywalled, but summarized &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-defends-facebook-advertising-model-we-dont-sell-peoples-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) relies on all-too-familiar refrains to explain the dubious principles and so-called “facts” behind Facebook’s business model. It’s the same old song we’ve heard before. And, as usual, it wildly misses users’ actual privacy concerns and preferences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Users Prefer Relevant Ads&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He starts with one of his greatest hits: “People consistently tell us that if they’re going to see ads, they want them to be relevant.” This perpetuates the ad industry’s favorite false dichotomy: either consumers can have “relevant” ads—targeted using huge collections of sensitive behavioral data—or they can be bombarded by spam for knock-off Viagra and weight-loss supplements. The truth is that ads &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;can be made “relevant” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; profitable based on the context in which they’re shown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, like putting ads for outdoor gear in a nature magazine. To receive relevant ads, you do not need to submit to data brokers harvesting the entire history of everything you’ve done on and off the web and using it to build a sophisticated dossier about who you are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zuckerberg soothingly reassures users that “You can find out why you’re seeing an ad and change your preferences to get ads you’re interested in. And you can use our transparency tools to see every different ad an advertiser is showing to anyone else.” But a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewinternet.org/2019/01/16/facebook-algorithms-and-personal-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent Pew survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on how users understand Facebook’s data collection and advertising practices, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/guided-tour-data-facebook-uses-target-ads&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;our own efforts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to disentangle Facebook’s ad preferences, tell a far different story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pew found that 74% of U.S. adult Facebook users didn’t even know that Facebook maintained information on their advertising interests and preferences in the first place. When Pew directed users to the ad preferences page where some of this information resides, 88% found there that Facebook had generated inferences about them, including household income level and political and ethnic “affinities.” Over a quarter of respondents said the categories “do not very or at all accurately represent them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It gets worse. Even when the advertising preferences Facebook had assigned to them &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; relevant to their real interests, users were not comfortable with the company compiling that information. As Pew reports, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;about half of users (51%) say they are not very or not at all comfortable with Facebook creating this list about their interests and traits.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we’d like to know: on what basis does Zuckerberg claim that users—who Pew has demonstrated are overwhelming unaware of and uncomfortable with the data collection and targeting that powers Facebook’s business model—are clamoring for the kinds of “relevant” ads Facebook is providing? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/styles/large/public/2019/01/25/consentflow.png?itok=0miWSIRL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;475&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Source: https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His op-ed goes on to claim that “when we asked people for permission to use this information to improve their ads as part of our compliance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the vast majority agreed because they prefer more relevant ads.” If Zuckerberg is referring here to the consent requests that users were prompted to click through last spring (documented in detail in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and pictured above), then this statement is a stretch at best. Those requests were part of a convoluted process engineered to maximize the ways a user could say “yes.” In particular, it took one tap of a button to “opt in” to Facebook’s terms, but three levels of dialog to decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;We Don’t Sell Your Data*&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, Zuckerberg deploys Facebook’s favorite PR red herring: he says that Facebook does not sell your data. It may be the case that Facebook does not transfer user data to third parties in exchange for money. But there are many other ways to invade users’ privacy. For example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the company indisputably &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;does&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; sell access to users’ personal information in the form of targeted advertising spots. No matter &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/what-we-want-learn-zuckerbergs-congressional-testimonies-week&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;how Zuckerberg slices it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Facebook’s business model &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/new-documents-show-facebook&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;revolves around monetizing your data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transparency is a necessary, but not sufficient, principle for Facebook to rely on here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just knowing how you&#039;re being tracked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/were-uncanny-valley-targeted-advertising&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;doesn&#039;t make it less invasive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And any transparency efforts have to confront the fact that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;roughly half of Americans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; simply don&#039;t trust social media companies like Facebook to protect their data in the first place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Saying One Thing and Lobbying Another&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zuckerberg ends his op-ed with a call for government regulation codifying the principles of “transparency, choice, and control.” But in reality, Facebook is tirelessly fighting against laws that might do just that: it is actively &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/eff-appellate-court-protect-biometric-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;battling to undermine Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in court, and the Internet Association, of which Facebook is a member, has asked California legislators to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/facebooks-latest-scandal-shows-we-need-stronger-privacy-laws&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;weaken the California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and is pushing for a national law &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/game-rigged-congress-invites-no-consumer-privacy-advocates-its-consumer-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;only if it “preempts” and rolls back those vital state protections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nearly all of Zuckerberg’s claims will be familiar to anyone who’s followed Facebook’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/12/data-privacy-scandals-and-public-policy-picking-speed-2018-year-review&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent privacy issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But Facebook users are ready for something new: policies that promote real privacy and user choice, and not just the tired excuses and non-sequiturs that Zuckerberg published today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>A Guided Tour of the Data Facebook Uses to Target Ads</title>
    <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/guided-tour-data-facebook-uses-target-ads</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field__items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field__item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week, Pew released the results of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewinternet.org/2019/01/16/facebook-algorithms-and-personal-data/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a survey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; investigating how users understand Facebook’s data collection practices and how they react when shown what the platform thinks it knows about them. The upshot is that 74% of users weren’t aware that Facebook assembles lists of their interests and traits. 88% of respondents were assigned “categories” for advertising, which could include racial or ethnic “affinities” and political leanings. 58% of those users were “not comfortable” with the company compiling that information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Essentially, this means that more than half of Facebook&#039;s users are unhappy with the major thrust of the company&#039;s business model—surveillance-based advertising—even after they&#039;ve learned more about the info that the company has gotten from surveilling them. This is unsurprising: just &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/were-uncanny-valley-targeted-advertising&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;knowing how you&#039;re being tracked doesn&#039;t necessarily make the tracking or the targeted ads less creepy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And while Facebook gives you some control over what data it uses to show you ads, it does not give you any way to stop the data from being collected in the first place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t know what goes into determining your “categories,” but it is likely grounded in the more concrete data the company knows about you: what you “like,” what third-party websites and apps you use, and the physical location of your smartphone and your computer. Facebook allows advertisers to target you based on any one of these categories of data, as well as by more nebulous metrics like “similarity” to other users. Though you might not know it, much of this data is visible to average users in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ad Preferences page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this post, we’ll go through each category of data to explain where it comes from and what it means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do they know?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are four main ways Facebook collects data about you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first is through actions you take on Facebook platforms, like Instagram, Whatsapp, and Facebook itself, including Liking posts and clicking on ads. You can see a summary of what it knows about you this way under the “Your Interests” tab. Every time you take an action in a Facebook product, it contributes to the profile shown here. Some of the items in this list are specific companies or pages you’ve interacted with, and others are interests that it’s attributed to you indirectly based on your actions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption caption-center&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-width-container&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2019/01/24/your_interests.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Some of these pages are things I’ve actually clicked on, and some of them are “related to” things I’ve interacted with. Many of them are wrong.&quot; width=&quot;998&quot; height=&quot;759&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Some of these pages are things I’ve actually clicked on, and some of them are “related to” things I’ve interacted with. For the record, I have no idea why it thinks I like Taylor Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Further down, under “Your Information -&amp;gt; Your Categories,” you can see more ways Facebook classifies you for advertisers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewinternet.org/2019/01/16/facebook-algorithms-and-personal-data/pi_2019-01-16_facebook-algorithms_0-03/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Pew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a majority (60%) of users are placed into 10 or more categories by Facebook, and these categories can include political and ethnic &quot;affinities.&quot; About half of users are assigned to a political category, and 21% are assigned a &quot;multicultural affinity&quot; by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption caption-center&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-width-container&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2019/01/24/your_categories.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;990&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Facebook’s data about my birthday and politics -- which I have deliberately fuzzed -- are off, but its deductions about my travel habits and home (in San Francisco) are spot on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, Facebook allows businesses to upload lists of people they want to reach directly with contact information. For example, if a big box store collects email addresses as part of a rewards program, it can tell Facebook to target ads at everyone it has an email for. This also allows advertisers to target people using other sources of data, like publicly-available voter records or lists of names purchased from data brokers. Facebook often processes these data in a hashed or obfuscated form, and maintains that it does not save or use them for any purpose other than this direct targeting. You can see which companies and groups have targeted you in this way under “Advertisers -&amp;gt; Who used a contact list added to Facebook.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption caption-center&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-width-container&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2019/01/24/contact_list.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;992&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The companies here have targeted me with ads using their own lists of contact information, potentially including my name, email, or phone number. Facebook lets companies link any of these identifiers to a Facebook profile to serve ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Third, Facebook tracks your activity on the rest of the internet. Thanks to tech like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pixel tracking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and Facebook’s third-party ad network, Facebook can track a great deal of your activity on other websites and in different apps on your phone. According to our own research, Facebook has pixels or other cookie-sharing code on about 30% of the top 10,000 sites on the web. And according to its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/marketing/audience-network&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;own marketing literature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the company’s tracking tech is used in 32% of the top 500 android apps and reaches 1 billion people per month. Under “Whose website or app you’ve visited,” you can see a list of the advertisers Facebook believes you’ve interacted with in this way.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The data recorded here may include activity from any device or browser you’ve used to log in to Facebook in the past, so some of it might not actually be yours. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption caption-center&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-width-container&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2019/01/24/whose_website.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;988&quot; height=&quot;589&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;This kind of third-party tracking can be stopped with Privacy Badger!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, Facebook can collect location data through its apps (including Instagram and Messenger), by asking to “know your location” in your browser, and by logging where you connect to the Internet. It uses that data to serve location-targeted ads as well as to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/help/175683976191028&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;determine when specific people are visiting specific brick-and-mortar stores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, part of its efforts to link digital ad impressions to purchases in meatspace. Even with a good understanding of how it works, researchers have found it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/facebook-s-location-tracking-for-ads-can-t-be-switched-off-report-1965202&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;incredibly difficult to turn off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; location-based ad targeting on Facebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowledge, not power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook shows you a bit of what they know about your activity, plus a limited window into who can target you with certain kinds of ads. But it doesn’t give you any control over how it collects or uses your data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under Ad Settings, you have the option to “opt out” of seeing targeted ads in a couple of ways: you can turn off targeted ads served &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Facebook using data collected &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Facebook (e.g. with pixels), and you can turn off ads you see around the web that are targeted using your activity &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Facebook. Both of these may help you if you’re tired of the same electric toothbrush ad stalking you across cyberspace, but they do nothing to stop the collection of your data in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/2019/01/24/ad_settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;988&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can also opt out of seeing ads from individual advertisers by clicking on the little “X” in the top-right corner of each icon — one at a time. There’s no way to turn off ads from a single source in bulk. And if you want to stop advertisers from targeting you based on your location or your contact information in the future, you’re out of luck. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what good is all this? Well, we do applaud Facebook’s strides towards transparency. This window into its targeted ad ecosystem is more straightforward and more granular than many of its competitors, most of whom perform the same kinds of tracking. But without meaningful ways to act on this data, the page mostly serves as a creepy reminder that Facebook follows you just about everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luckily, you can take matters into your own hands. You can uninstall or disable Facebook’s mobile apps to stop most of the company’s location tracking. And you can install &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pb&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to stop third-party tracking around the web, including through Facebook’s pixels and Like buttons. The more users learn what Facebook is doing, the more they can make informed decisions about their privacy, including putting pressure on lawmakers and companies to do better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
